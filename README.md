# Headless vs. Monolith eCommerce Platform
You've undoubtedly heard that headless ecommerce platforms are faster than monolithic systems in a variety of industry reviews. In this essay, we'll explain why using easy-to-understand example.

An ecommerce portal's performance over time is influenced by the introduction of new technologies and their adoption into the platform.

As an example, consider a military convoy of ships with a single slow ship at the rear (let's say it has 1X speed). Even if you employ the coolest and fastest ship to the convoy, it will still arrive at the destination at the speed of the slowest vessel.

[Headless commerce](https://virtocommerce.com/headless-ecommerce), on the other hand, can be symbolized as a commercial shipping line in which various kinds of vessels move independently at their optimum velocity. Fast ships (apps), then the front end (10X speed), slower for the middle layer apps (3-5X), and very slow (1X) as the back-end items. Because the vessels are not reliant on each other, a new ship may be introduced at any time and put to work to boost traffic speed and volume.

The headless architecture, therefore, enables separate technology upgrades at any part of the ecommerce platform (front end, back end, middleware) without affecting other components and thus provides for rapid reaction to new technological patterns.

In contrast, when innovative technologies for the monolithic system are introduced, the entire system must be redesigned or a complicated and time-consuming rebuilding is required.

What factors influence the ecommerce portal's performance in addition to how often it is updated? The capacity to scale various elements of the platform, known as scalability. Assume that there aren't enough resources for certain ecommerce platform processes. If that's the case, the ability to add software instances and server resources is a major boost in productivity and adaptability.

Scalability and load balancing are more difficult and complicated for a monolith than for a headless architecture. Take-downs for updates, as well as complex procedures, are sometimes required. You may add software instances, server power, and other resources to the appropriate layer as needed without fear of system downtime for a headless ecommerce platform.

Aside from that, because of the headless design, the strain can be dispersed across the platform â€” mostly to the fast front end, by unloading the middleware and especially the back end. This feature is linked to corporate expectations and allows for faster delivery of product data to consumers.

Headless architecture is a popular technology trend for commerce, because of the potential for multistage updates and scalability. The system's update rate varies across parts; it's faster on the front end. This Lego-inspired architecture allows ecommerce entrepreneurs to implement new business ideas rapidly and profit as fast as possible.
